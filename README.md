# Redish

## Overview
Redish is a simple, educational project demonstrating the core concepts of a networked, in-memory data structure store, similar to Redis. It utilizes a client-server architecture written in C++ to handle basic operations like setting, getting, and deleting data.

### Features
Client-Server Architecture: Uses C++ sockets for communication between the client and the server.

Key-Value Storage: Supports basic operations for storing strings, integers, or other data mapped to unique string keys (implementation dependent).

In-Memory Storage: Data is stored in memory for fast access (non-persistent in this basic version).

Pure C++ Implementation: Built entirely using C++.
